<h2>Who are we?</h2>
<br>
<P>Historically, surnames evolved as a way to sort people into groups - by occupation, place of origin, clan affiliation, patronage, parentage, adoption, and even physical characteristics.Amanzi also means water.Many of the modern surnames in the dictionary can be traced back to Britain and Ireland.We are a Non-Profit Organisation also known as NGO. We only operate in South Africa. Our purpose is to help the communities that are struggling. We provide services to communities that are suffering e.g., water. We are here to investigate the problem and come up with solutions.Amanzi was found in 2003 by Lonwabo Gumede, MasterX and MrSoloDarkX. The community will be provided solution by Amanzi.</P>

<h2>Why do we help poor communities?</h2>
<p>Most people cannot wash dishes, use toilets, and wash hands. Some people don’t even have water tanks. Having no water can lead to dehydration and people can die from it. It is very hygienic which also leads to people smelling and having bad breath. Some communities can’t grow crops due to having no water and this is where malnutrition kicks and it increases the possibility of death and also diseases. Keeping a livestock requires water because people rely on keeping a livestock to find food and to earn an income which is difficult.  Most hospitals and clinics find it difficult to help their patients safely due to lack of water.</p>
