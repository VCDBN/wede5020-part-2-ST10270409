<p>We are here to donate money to charities because charities help poor communities get access to water which improves sanitation, health, and agriculture. We will be investing in communities to allow themselves to have water. We will invest also in some communitiesâ€™ education standards which will educate them the causes of water shortages, the effects, and the solutions and this can increase the awareness. We will build water tanks in poor communities so that people can gain access to water.</p>
